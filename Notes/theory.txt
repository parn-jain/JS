Executiun of JS Code :

Exicuted in exicution context
Exicution context is divided in 2 parts : Memory and Code

Happens in 2 phases:
Phase 1: Memory allocation (Initially variables are allocated with undefined and functions are allocated with lines of code in the funciton)
Phase 2: Line by line Code Exicution where memory is allocated with acrual value 

In case of calling of function , a new execution context is created in code box and same pricess is done, 
after reaching to return statement , if give controll to original Exicution Conrexg and allocate memory to the variable that calls the function 

THIS ALL THIGN IS MANAGED IN CALL STACK
and in the botumn of the stack there is a GLobal Exicution context and when a new function is invoked and a new exicution context is created , it put that exicution context insode the stack
